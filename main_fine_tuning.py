### Section 1 - First, let's import everything we will be needing.

from __future__ import print_function, division

import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.autograd import Variable

## If you want to keep a track of your network on tensorboard, set USE_TENSORBOARD TO 1 in config file.

if USE_TENSORBOARD:
    from pycrayon import CrayonClient
    cc = CrayonClient(hostname=TENSORBOARD_SERVER)
    try:
        cc.remove_experiment(EXP_NAME)
    except:
        pass
    foo = cc.create_experiment(EXP_NAME)


## If you want to use the GPU, set GPU_MODE TO 1 in config file

use_gpu = GPU_MODE
if use_gpu:
    torch.cuda.set_device(CUDA_DEVICE)

count=0

### SECTION 2 - data loading and shuffling/augmentation/normalization : all handled by torch automatically.

# This is a little hard to understand initially, so I'll explain in detail here!

# For training, the data gets transformed by undergoing augmentation and normalization. 
# The RandomSizedCrop basically takes a crop of an image at various scales between 0.01 to 0.8 times the size of the image and resizes it to given number
# Horizontal flip is a common technique in computer vision to augment the size of your data set. Firstly, it increases the number of times the network gets
# to see the same thing, and secondly it adds rotational invariance to your networks learning.


# Just normalization for validation, no augmentation. 

# You might be curious where these numbers came from? For the most part, they were used in popular architectures like the AlexNet paper. 
# It is important to normalize your dataset by calculating the mean and standard deviation of your dataset images and making your data unit normed. However,
# it takes a lot of computation to do so, and some papers have shown that it doesn't matter too much if they are slightly off. So, people just use imagenet
# dataset's mean and standard deviation to normalize their dataset approximately. These numbers are imagenet mean and standard deviation!

# If you want to read more, transforms is a function from torchvision, and you can go read more here - http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/transforms.html
data_transforms = {
    'train': transforms.Compose([
        transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224),
        transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
        transforms.ToTensor(),
        transforms.Normalize([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], [0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    ]),
    'val': transforms.Compose([
        transforms.Resize(224),
        transforms.CenterCrop(224),
        transforms.ToTensor(),
        transforms.Normalize([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], [0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    ]),
}



# Enter the absolute path of the dataset folder below. Keep in mind that this code expects data to be in same format as Imagenet. I encourage you to
# use your own dataset. In that case you need to organize your data such that your dataset folder has EXACTLY two folders. Name these 'train' and 'val'
# Yes, this is case sensitive. The 'train' folder contains training set and 'val' fodler contains validation set on which accuracy is measured. 

# The structure within 'train' and 'val' folders will be the same. They both contain one folder per class. All the images of that class are inside the 
# folder named by class name.

# So basically, if your dataset has 3 classes and you're trying to classify between pictures of 1) dogs 2) cats and 3) humans,
# say you name your dataset folder 'data_directory'. Then inside 'data_directory' will be 'train' and 'test'. Further, Inside 'train' will be 
# 3 folders - 'dogs', 'cats', 'humans'. All training images for dogs will be inside this 'dogs'. Similarly, within 'val' as well there will be the same
# 3 folders. 

## So, the structure looks like this : 
# data_dar
#      |- train 
#            |- dogs
#                 |- dog_image_1
#                 |- dog_image_2
#                        .....

#            |- cats
#                 |- cat_image_1
#                 |- cat_image_1
#                        .....
#            |- humans
#      |- val
#            |- dogs
#            |- cats
#            |- humans

data_dir = DATA_DIR
dsets = {x: datasets.ImageFolder(os.path.join(data_dir, x), data_transforms[x])
         for x in ['train', 'val']}

                                               shuffle=True, num_workers=25)
                for x in ['train', 'val']}
dset_sizes = {x: len(dsets[x]) for x in ['train', 'val']}
dset_classes = dsets['train'].classes


### SECTION 3 : Writing the functions that do training and validation phase. 

# These functions basically do forward propogation, back propogation, loss calculation, update weights of model, and save best model!


## The below function will train the model. Here's a short basic outline - 

# For the number of specified epoch's, the function goes through a train and a validation phase. Hence the nested for loop. 

# In both train and validation phase, the loaded data is forward propogated through the model (architecture defined ahead). 
# In PyTorch, the data loader is basically an iterator. so basically there's a get_element function which gets called everytime 
# the program iterates over data loader. So, basically, get_item on dset_loader below gives data, which contains 2 tensors - input and target. 
# target is the class number. Class numbers are assigned by going through the train/val folder and reading folder names in alphabetical order.
# So in our case cats would be first, dogs second and humans third class.

# Forward prop is as simple as calling model() function and passing in the input. 

# Variables are basically wrappers on top of PyTorch tensors and all that they do is keep a track of every process that tensor goes through.
# The benefit of this is, that you don't need to write the equations for backpropogation, because the history of computations has been tracked
# and pytorch can automatically differentiate it! Thus, 2 things are SUPER important. ALWAYS check for these 2 things. 
# 1) NEVER overwrite a pytorch variable, as all previous history will be lost and autograd won't work.
# 2) Variables can only undergo operations that are differentiable.
