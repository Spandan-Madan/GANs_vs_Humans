# NNs_vs_Humans

Recently, GANs have shown great promise in generating fake faces, which look very much like real people. If you don't believe me, take a look at this website - thispersondoesnotexist.com

So, it is clear that GANs can fool humans (at least somewhat) when it comes to faces. However, sitting at a coffee shop on a sunday I was wondering if they can fool other Neural Networks like classification CNNs as well? So I decided to do this experiment to generate lots of faces using GANs and try to classify them using CNNs.

Turns out they can't fool a CNN. I thought this was pretty interesting, so I decided to publish my code base here for others.
